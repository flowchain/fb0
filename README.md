Extremely light-weight flow-based programming runtime for IoT

# fb0

*fb0* (flow-based zero) is an extremely light weight, and ultra fast runtime for flow-based programming. It aims to be used in [flowchain](https://github.com/flowchain/flowchain) for Internet of Things application development.

fb0 is unidirectional (on-way data flow) and single output port.

## Usage

fb0 is used with [flowchain](https://github.com/flowchain/flowchain). 

## Roadmap

* [Flow-based Zero]:  Unidirectional and single output port.
* [Flow-Based One]:  Unidirectional and multiple output ports.

## License

fb0 is released under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/MIT). See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
